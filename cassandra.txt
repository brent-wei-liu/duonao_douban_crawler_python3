brew install cassandra

To have launchd start cassandra now and restart at login:
  brew services start cassandra
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  cassandra -f

You can start Cassandra with sudo service cassandra start and stop it with sudo service cassandra stop. However, normally the service will start automatically. For this reason be sure to stop it if you need to make any configuration changes.
Verify that Cassandra is running by invoking nodetool status from the command line.
The default location of configuration files is /etc/cassandra.
The default location of log and data directories is /var/log/cassandra/ and /var/lib/cassandra


Cassandra file locations
------------------------
- Properties: `/usr/local/etc/cassandra`
- Logs: `/usr/local/var/log/cassandra`
- Data: `/usr/local/var/lib/cassandra/data`
